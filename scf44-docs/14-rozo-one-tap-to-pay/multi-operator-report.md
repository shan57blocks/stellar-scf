# MPP Router, open and multi-operator: provider onboarding and direct settlement

MPP Router by ROZO · Stellar mainnet · last updated 2026-09-21

## 1. Description

MPP Router is not a single-operator gateway. Independent providers run their own servers, list themselves without anyone at ROZO approving, and get paid on their own keys. This document describes who is live, how they got there, and what each proof does and does not show.

## 2. Operators live today

Three third-party operators are live. Agent402 and Stellar Indexer serve paid calls with payment settling to their own Stellar keys, both onboarded through the self-serve flow with no ROZO approval step. Mercury Data provides Stellar contract infrastructure behind a router-hosted paywall, with payment settling directly to Mercury's own Stellar address:

| Operator | Shape | Verified by a real paid call | Settlement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Agent402** (agent402.tools) | Runs its own x402 endpoints; the router relays the buyer's request and payment credential unchanged | 2026-09-12 · tx [`cb81cc75…838e`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/cb81cc75af8ad64925d0a594efa17483d25aef26f01e12e82b12f3d6ed98838e) | Buyer → Agent402's Stellar address, directly |
| **Stellar Indexer** by Creit Tech (stellarindexer.com) | Runs its own authenticated API; MPP Router hosts the x402 paywall in front of it | 2026-09-14 · tx [`e577302e…28de`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/e577302ef37e8edeb0ed5af40f679bce6b02198a238f584d2e21f9278ef728de) | Buyer → Creit Tech's Stellar address, directly; the router settles only after the origin answered 2xx |
| **Mercury Data** by xycloo Labs (mercurydata.app) | Runs its own indexer; MPP Router hosts the x402 paywall in front of it (four routes, $0.001/call) and calls the origin with a provider-authorised credential only after payment | Direct settlement verified 2026-09-20: [tx 3a22c2ce…](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/3a22c2ce1cb2a60d71dc402c5545d25da5faae22f500374aaa4bf6bd49775d1e), [ledger record](https://apiserver.mpprouter.dev/v1/ledger?tx=3a22c2ce1cb2a60d71dc402c5545d25da5faae22f500374aaa4bf6bd49775d1e) (delivered, upstream 200); earlier charge-verified 2026-08-11 via the router pool | Buyer → Mercury's own Stellar address, settled after the origin answers 2xx (since 2026-09-15) |

In both transactions the USDC transfer goes from the router's verification wallet to the operator's own address; no ROZO account is in the path. Each operator's public verification record shows the checks, the proof type and its exact meaning, and the settlement transaction:

## 3. Evidence

### 3.1 Independent providers run their own servers and are paid on their own keys

- **Agent402** operates `agent402.tools` (578 x402 endpoints, its own Stellar facilitator). Five routes are listed with the operator's written permission (2026-09-05); `GET /api/stablecoin-peg` went through the paid gate on 2026-09-12. The router paid $0.003 USDC through Agent402's own 402 and the transfer landed on Agent402's advertised `payTo`. The router does not proxy these calls, hold funds, or take a fee.
- **Stellar Indexer** operates `api.stellarindexer.com` (Bearer-token API, no payment layer of its own). Creit Tech supplied a payout address and the per-call prices from its own price list ($0.004/call for Classic Data and Contracts' Data). The router serves `https://stellar-indexer-pay.mpprouter.dev/<path>`: unpaid requests get an x402 402 naming Creit Tech's address; paid requests are forwarded to the origin with the stored credential and settled only after the origin answers 2xx. The verification call paid $0.004 USDC to Creit Tech's address on 2026-09-14.

Catalog effect: `GET https://apiserver.mpprouter.dev/services` now carries routes with `settlement: direct` and an `operator` object naming a non-ROZO operator (`settlement_mode: relay` for Agent402, `router_paywall` for Stellar Indexer).

### 3.2 Self-serve onboarding, no manual approval

Flow (all public endpoints, no ROZO human in the path):

1. `POST /v1/providers/check`: free: reachability, 402 discovery, dialect (MPP or x402), advertised networks and payouts.
2. `POST /v1/providers/register`: one of three ownership proofs, chosen by the provider: `x402_pay_to` (the live 402 advertises the registered address), `well_known` (a token published under the provider's origin), or `wallet_signature`. A router-hosted registration uses `hosted_origin_auth` (the origin accepts the supplied credential). The public record states in words what each proof does and does not prove.
3. `POST /v1/providers/verify`: free 402 probe, then one bounded real payment (≤ $0.02, from the router's verification wallet, to the provider's registered address), then automatic `published`. Failures return a machine-readable `code`, an `action`, and `can_safely_retry` (the router never pays twice for one registration version; a frozen attempt is reconciled from the ledger, not re-paid).
4. `GET /v1/providers/:id/verification`: the durable public record.

Both listings above were produced by exactly this path. Portal: https://www.mpprouter.dev/onboard/x402 (providers with a 402) and https://www.mpprouter.dev/onboard/start (providers without a payment layer: the hosted paywall).

### 3.3 Provider-onboarding tooling

- Self-serve registration, verification and public records: `mpprouter/rozo-mpprouter` PR #135, #149, #150.
- Router-hosted paywall for APIs without a payment layer (credential stored encrypted under a Worker secret, never returned): PR #151, #152.
- Provider dashboard (token-gated): `/providers/:id/dashboard`; public provider pages and the `/services` listing: `mpprouter/mpprouter-landingpage` PR #44, #46, #47, #48 to #52.
- Machine discovery: `/.well-known/x402` and `/llms.txt` carry third-party routes with per-route `payTo`.

### 3.4 Service-quality routing

- Per-route metrics (provider success rate, p50 latency, refund rate, caller-error vs router-fault attribution) are recorded at the proxy chokepoint every paid call passes through and published at `GET /v1/stats` and https://www.mpprouter.dev/stats.
- Selection: `GET /v1/services/select?capability=<id>` chooses among published routes that declare the same capability contract (`GET /v1/services/capabilities`), ordered deterministically: healthy providers with ≥ 5 fresh samples by success rate, then p50 latency, then price; providers without enough samples by price; degraded last; `offline` excluded. The response names the selected provider's `public_path` and `pay_to` before any quote, and `&provider=<id>` pins a provider (never silently replaced). Policy and thresholds are returned with every response.
- Honest status: at report time no published third-party route declares a capability id, so the endpoint answers `no_eligible_provider` with the policy; the ordering is covered by the test suite (`tests/provider-t3-loop.test.ts`). It engages as soon as two operators declare the same contract.

### 3.5 Independent security review

HackenProof audit report: https://github.com/mpprouter/rozo-mpprouter/releases/download/v0.2.2/HackenProof.Audit.Report.for.MPP.Router.ROZO.pdf (attached to release [v0.2.2](https://github.com/mpprouter/rozo-mpprouter/releases/tag/v0.2.2)).

## 4. Scope and limits

- Both self-serve verification payments were technical validation spend by ROZO ($0.003 and $0.004), not organic buyer demand.
- Mercury Data is a provider-authorised managed integration, not a self-serve onboarding in the sense of §3.1: ROZO configured the routes and the router holds the origin credential by agreement. Settlement is direct to Mercury's own address since 2026-09-15; the 2026-09-20 verification payment was ROZO technical validation spend ($0.001), not organic demand.
- `x402_pay_to` and `hosted_origin_auth` prove that the endpoint's payment configuration matches the registered address (and, for hosted, that the registrant can authenticate to the origin). Neither proves private-key custody; the public records say so verbatim.
- The hosted-paywall shape keeps the paywall on ROZO infrastructure; the operator's API and key stay theirs and settlement is still direct. Agent402 is the fully self-operated sample; Stellar Indexer is the hosted sample.
- Operator addresses are not reproduced in this report; they are visible in the linked verification records and on-chain.
