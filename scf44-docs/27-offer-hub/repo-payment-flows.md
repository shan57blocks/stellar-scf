# Payment Flows

This document details the complete payment lifecycle flows in OFFER-HUB, including state transitions and transaction sequences.

## Overview

OFFER-HUB supports two payment modes:
1. **Crypto-Native (Default):** USDC on Stellar with Trustless Work escrow
2. **Airtm Mode:** Fiat on/off-ramp via Airtm

---

## Crypto-Native Flow (Default)

### 1. Deposit Flow

**User deposits USDC to their Stellar wallet address**

```
User sends USDC to deposit address
  ↓
BlockchainMonitor detects incoming payment
  ↓
Balance credited (available += amount)
  ↓
Event emitted: balance.credited
```

**Implementation:**
- Each user has a unique Stellar wallet (invisible, server-managed)
- BlockchainMonitor streams payments from Horizon
- Balance updated in database
- Real-time notification via SSE

---

### 2. Order Creation & Escrow Flow

**Complete flow from order creation to escrow funding**

```
1. POST /orders (create order)
   ↓ Status: CREATED
   
2. POST /orders/:id/reserve (reserve funds)
   ↓ Balance: available → reserved
   ↓ Status: RESERVED
   
3. POST /escrow (create escrow contract)
   ↓ Deploy Soroban contract on Stellar
   ↓ Platform signs as approver
   ↓ Status: ESCROW_CREATING → ESCROW_CREATED
   
4. POST /escrow/:id/fund (fund escrow)
   ↓ Buyer signs transaction
   ↓ USDC transferred to escrow contract
   ↓ Balance: reserved → 0 (on-chain)
   ↓ Status: ESCROW_FUNDED → IN_PROGRESS
```

**State Transitions:**
```
CREATED → RESERVED → ESCROW_CREATING → ESCROW_CREATED → ESCROW_FUNDED → IN_PROGRESS
```

---

### 3. Release Flow (Happy Path)

**Seller completes work, buyer approves, funds released**

```
1. POST /resolution/release (seller: change milestone status)
   ↓ Seller signs: changeMilestoneStatus(milestoneId, "completed")

   ↓ Milestone approved on-chain
   
3. POST /resolution/release (buyer: release funds)
   ↓ Buyer signs: releaseFunds()
   ↓ USDC transferred from escrow to seller's wallet
   ↓ Seller balance credited (available += amount)
   ↓ Order status: COMPLETED
   ↓ Event emitted: order.completed, balance.credited
```

**Total Transactions:** 3 Stellar transactions  
**Signers:** Seller (1x), Buyer (2x)

---

### 4. Refund Flow

**Buyer requests refund, platform resolves**

```
1. POST /resolution/refund (buyer: dispute escrow)
   ↓ Buyer signs: disputeEscrow()
   ↓ Escrow marked as disputed on-chain

2. POST /resolution/refund (platform: resolve dispute)

```

   ↓ Order status: DISPUTED
   
2. POST /disputes/:id/resolve (support: resolve with split)
   ↓ Support specifies: releaseAmount, refundAmount
   ↓ Platform signs: resolveDispute(releaseAmount, refundAmount)
   ↓ USDC split between seller and buyer
   ↓ Both balances credited
   ↓ Order status: COMPLETED (or REFUNDED, depending on majority)
   ↓ Dispute status: RESOLVED
```

**Example:**
- Order amount: $100
- Resolution: $60 to seller, $40 to buyer
- Both parties receive their portion

---

### 6. Withdrawal Flow
