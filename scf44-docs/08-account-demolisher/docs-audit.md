title: Security audit and remediation
description: The audit scope, the completed hardening and its code references, and the dependency posture that gates every release.
---

This page is the published record of Account Demolisher's security audit and the remediation
of its findings. It stays current as the audit proceeds. Before it operates on mainnet, the app
requires you to acknowledge the tool's independent-audit status, a deliberate safety gate
(`src/components/layout/MainnetConfirm.tsx`).

## Audit scope

The independent audit covers five areas:

- Mediator key handling: the `MEDIATOR_SECRET` HMAC master and the per-flow ephemeral keys.
- The merge-envelope validator: the single forward shape the mediator co-signs.
- Plan-generation correctness: the plan tree, cycle detection, and the anti-stranding ordering.
- Transaction and signature handling: fees, time bounds, sequence handling, and multisig signature merging.
- An SDK supply-chain review of the dependency graph.

## External audit status

The independent audit runs through Audit Bank and is a release blocker for the mainnet launch.
Each finding it delivers is listed here with its severity and its resolution: fixed with a code
reference, or formally accepted with a rationale. No high or critical finding stays open at launch.

Ahead of that audit, the team ran its own multi-agent security review across the same five areas
and remediated every finding it raised. Those fixes are merged into `main`, and the codebase is at
its maximum ready state for the external audit to build on.

## Remediation completed

The following defensive changes ship in `main` as part of the mainnet-readiness work:

- **Authorization-entry guard.** The sign-time allow-list inspects each Soroban operation's
  authorization entries and refuses any that authorize contract creation or wasm upload, closing a
  gap the operation-level check alone leaves open (`src/lib/stellar/allowlist.ts`).
- **Dependency audit as a release gate.** Continuous integration fails on any high or critical
  advisory in the production dependency tree (`pnpm audit --prod --audit-level high`) rather than
  only reporting it.
- **Two high advisories patched.** The transitive `ip-address` and `nanoid` high-severity advisories
  are resolved by pinning patched versions through `pnpm.overrides`, not suppressed. The installed
  versions are `ip-address` 10.5.0 and `nanoid` 3.3.18.
- **Mainnet allow-list provenance.** Every mainnet contract entry cites a real upstream source,
  verified against the protocols' own published deployment files, and a source-level test asserts the
  list stays complete and correctly enforced (`tests/unit/allowlist-mainnet.test.ts`).

## Dependency posture

Runtime dependencies are pinned by a committed `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and known-vulnerable transitive
packages are pinned to patched versions through `pnpm.overrides`. The release gate blocks on any
high or critical advisory, and the production tree carries none.

Two advisories below that threshold are formally accepted and recorded in
`pnpm.auditConfig.ignoreGhsas`, each because it is not reachable in this app:

- `GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq` (uuid, moderate): affects the `v3`/`v5`/`v6` buffer-writing paths, which the app does not use.
- `GHSA-848j-6mx2-7j84` (elliptic, low): an ECDSA edge case, where signing here is ed25519 through the Stellar SDK rather than elliptic-curve ECDSA.

Each acceptance is revisited when the external audit runs.
