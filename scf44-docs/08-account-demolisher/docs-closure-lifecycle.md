title: Closure lifecycle
description: The four stages a closure moves through, and what each one guarantees.
---

A closure is a sequence of ordinary Stellar transactions. The app's job is to assemble the
right ones in the right order, ground them in real network state before you sign, and
recover cleanly when that state shifts underneath.

Four stages: **audit**, **plan**, **simulate**, **execute**.

## 1. Audit

Horizon is read for the full account state, Soroban RPC for active SEP-41 allowances, and
the four supported protocols for open positions. The result is one read-only snapshot
everything downstream works from.

The audit also computes a merge verdict. Two conditions block a close outright: the
`auth_immutable` flag, and sponsorships the account holds for _other_ accounts. Entries the
account sponsors for itself are counted separately, because they are released during the
close.

Where discovery cannot see everything, the preview says so rather than proceeding as if
the account were fully understood.

## 2. Plan

The audit, the discovered positions, and the discovered allowances feed a pure generator
that emits a directed acyclic graph. There are 13 node kinds, and a node is emitted only
when the account actually needs it.

Each node carries its dependencies as explicit edges. A Blend withdraw waits for that
pool's repay. A rewards claim waits for its withdraw. The classic close waits for every
Soroban node, so a merge never runs while a position is open.

The graph is validated when built: duplicate ids, missing dependency targets, and cycles
are all rejected.

## 3. Simulate

Every Soroban node is run through the RPC's `simulateTransaction`. The returned resource
fee, authorization entries, and ledger footprint are baked into the envelope.

The classic transaction is not RPC-simulated. It is built locally and its operation count
and fee floor are surfaced, because the real envelope is rebuilt from fresh state at
submit time anyway.

A node that cannot be simulated is marked failed or skipped in the preview rather than
being carried silently into execution.

## 4. Execute

Execution walks the graph in topological order using Kahn's algorithm, so the order is
stable and deterministic.

For each node the executor rebuilds it against current state, hands the unsigned envelope
to the connector for signing, checks it against the contract allow-list immediately before
signing every Soroban node, submits it, and waits for the receipt before marking the row
confirmed.

You sign once per transaction, not once for the plan, because Stellar cannot bundle
Soroban and classic operations into one signed envelope.

## What holds across the stages

**The merge never runs early.** Before the classic close the executor re-audits, re-checks
mergeability, re-probes for open Soroban positions, and refuses when the probe recorded any
error at all. It fails closed rather than assuming a failed read means no position.

**Failed dependencies cascade.** A node whose dependency did not confirm is skipped rather
than worked around.

**Nothing is reported done until it confirmed.** A node's executed record is what marks it
complete, and intermediate classic batches deliberately do not set it, so a retry cannot
skip an unrun merge while reporting success.

**Reads are re-verified.** Allowances derived from events are confirmed against the token's
own on-chain `allowance()` before they are acted on.
