description: The module map, how a request flows through the app, and where the trust boundaries fall.
---

The app is a Next.js 16 application. One page drives the whole closure, backed by a state
machine, a pure plan generator, and an executor that walks the plan on chain.

## Request flow

A closure runs through `/demolish`, which is a React page wired to an XState machine.

```
/demolish (React)
  └─ pageFlowMachine            src/lib/orchestrator/page-flow-machine.ts
       ├─ discover
       │    ├─ auditAccount               Horizon
       │    ├─ DirectContractProvider     on-chain DeFi discovery
       │    └─ enumerateAllowances        Soroban RPC
       ├─ preview
       │    ├─ resolveCreditPaths
       │    ├─ generatePlan               pure
       │    ├─ hydratePlanTransactions
       │    └─ simulateNode               real Soroban RPC simulation
       └─ execute
            └─ executePlanTreeOnChain     src/lib/orchestrator/executor.ts
```

The machine's states are `idle`, `discovering`, `previewing`, `awaiting_confirmation`,
`executing`, `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled`.

| Server       | `src/server/`                               | Signing relay, mediator secret, rate limiting                    |
| Config       | `src/lib/config/`                           | Networks, contracts, CSP, environment                            |

## Server surface

Three route groups, and nothing else:

| Route                                                                         | Purpose                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/mediator/sign`                                                          | Mints a flow and co-signs one validated forward envelope |
| `/api/plan`, `/api/plan/[id]`, `/api/plan/[id]/sign`, `/api/plan/[id]/events` | The multisig signing relay                               |
| `/api/soroswap`                                                               | Server-side proxy to the Soroswap aggregator             |

The server never receives a user key, never builds a transaction on a user's behalf, and
never submits one.

## Purity boundaries

Two core pieces take no network calls at all, which is what makes them testable and
deterministic:

- **`generatePlan`** is pure over `(audit, positions, allowances, destination, options)`.
  Its only impurity is reading the clock to estimate a Blend backstop unlock date, and
  tests pass a fixed value.
- **`batchClassicDemolition`** is a pure function from an account audit to an ordered list
  of classic batches.

Everything that touches the network sits outside those two.

## Trust boundaries

| Boundary                | Trust level             | Why                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browser                 | Highest                 | The user's key lives here and nowhere else                                                      |
| Server                  | Bounded                 | Holds one HMAC master secret, never a user key; its powers are constrained by strict validators |
| Horizon and Soroban RPC | Untrusted for integrity | Reads are treated as hints and re-verified before signing                                       |
| Wallet                  | Separate trusted signer | Shows its own confirmation and signs on its own                                                 |
| On-chain contracts      | Untrusted               | Checked against the allow-list immediately before every signature                               |

[The security model](/docs/developers/security/model) covers what defends each boundary.

## Rebuilding from fresh state

A plan you review is not the transaction that gets submitted. Before each classic phase
the executor re-reads the account, re-runs the audit, re-resolves credit paths, and
re-batches from that fresh state. Soroban nodes are rebuilt and re-simulated the same way.

This is what makes a stale sequence number self-correcting, and what stops a read from a
hostile RPC at preview time deciding what you actually sign.

## The docs site

This documentation is a separate Next.js app in `docs/`, tracked in the same repository.
It runs on port 3020 in development.
