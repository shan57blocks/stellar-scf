title: Mediator forward protocol
description: Per-flow key derivation, the flow token, and the single envelope shape the server will co-sign.
---

Stellar's `ACCOUNT_MERGE` is not credited as a deposit by most exchanges, and the memo an
exchange needs to attribute a deposit rides on the transaction. For a memo-required
exchange the close routes through an ephemeral **mediator** account: the user's account
merges into the mediator, then a separate two-operation forward carries the memo to the
exchange.

The server co-signs that forward, and only that exact shape.

## The endpoint

One route: `/api/mediator/sign`. It runs on the Node.js runtime because key derivation and
the validator pull in `node:crypto` and the Stellar SDK.

| Method                           | Behaviour                            | Rate limit       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `GET`                            | Mint a flow                          | None             |
| `POST`                           | Co-sign a forward envelope           | 5 per 60s per IP |
| `OPTIONS`                        | Preflight, 204                       |                  |
| `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD` | 405 with `allow: POST, GET, OPTIONS` |                  |

## 1. Mint a flow

```http
GET /api/mediator/sign?destination=G...
```

A missing or invalid destination returns **400** with code `INVALID_DESTINATION`.

Success returns **200** with exactly two fields, and no `ok` field:

```json
{ "flowToken": "<token>", "mediatorPublicKey": "G..." }
```

An unconfigured or malformed master seed returns **500** with code
`MEDIATOR_NOT_CONFIGURED`. The underlying configuration detail is deliberately scrubbed
from the response.

Each `GET` mints a fresh, independent flow.

## 2. Fund and merge into the mediator

Plan generation refuses to build a mediator plan without both the mediator public key and
the flow token. Without the token the forward could never be co-signed, which would strand
the funds in the mediator account.

The first classic batch is led by a `create_account` funding the mediator with 2 XLM, and
the final merge targets the mediator instead of the destination. See
[The classic batch](/docs/developers/internals/classic-batch).

## 3. Co-sign the forward

```http
POST /api/mediator/sign
Content-Type: application/json

{ "envelopeXdr": "...", "flowToken": "...", "network": "..." }
```

The request body is capped at 16,384 bytes. The server resolves the flow from the token,
re-derives that flow's signing key, validates the envelope, and only then signs.

## Key derivation

`MEDIATOR_SECRET` is a Stellar seed used **purely as an HMAC master key, never as a signing
key**. It holds no balance and signs nothing directly.

The master is the 32-byte raw ed25519 seed, memoized after first load. Two
domain-separation labels keep the two uses apart:

| Purpose               | HMAC-SHA-256 message                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Per-flow keypair seed | `mediator-flow-key:<nonceHex>`                          |
| Flow token MAC        | `mediator-flow-token:<nonceHex>.<expiry>.<destination>` |

The 32-byte digest becomes the flow's keypair directly. Derivation is deterministic and
stateless: the same nonce and master always produce the same keypair, so no per-flow seed
is ever stored, and the scheme survives across server instances.

### Seed validation

Two layers. The environment schema requires an `S` prefix and exactly 56 characters, and
treats an empty string as unset, so the app runs without a mediator configured. The
stricter ed25519-seed check runs at first use, throwing a specific message for an unset
versus a malformed seed.

### The flow token

Four dot-separated parts:

```
<nonceHex>.<expiryMillis>.<destination>.<macHex>
```

The nonce is 16 random bytes rendered as 32 hex characters. The MAC is 64 hex characters.
The token lives for **15 minutes**.

Verification returns null on every rejection rather than throwing, and checks in order:
the token is a string, it has four parts, the nonce matches `^[0-9a-f]{32}$`, the
destination is a valid public key, the expiry is finite and in the future, the MAC lengths
match, and the MACs are equal under a constant-time comparison.

The destination is committed **into the token**, which is what stops a leaked token from
redirecting a flow's funds.

## The accepted envelope

Exactly one shape is signable:

```
op0: PAYMENT       native XLM, sourced by the mediator, to destination D
op1: ACCOUNT_MERGE sourced by the mediator, to destination D  (the same D)
```

Binding both operations to one destination is the core of the design. Without it a
tampered envelope could pay the balance to one address and merge the reserve to another.

## Validation failure codes

Thirteen codes, surfaced verbatim in 400 responses. The first failure short-circuits, so
the order matters.

| #   | Code                                | Triggering condition                                                            |
| --- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `MALFORMED_XDR`                     | The envelope does not parse                                                     |
| 2   | `FEE_BUMP_NOT_ALLOWED`              | The envelope is a fee-bump                                                      |
| 3   | `FORWARD_TX_SOURCE_NOT_MEDIATOR`    | The transaction source is not the mediator                                      |
| 4   | `WRONG_OPERATION_COUNT`             | The operation count is not exactly 2                                            |
| 5   | `FORWARD_OP0_NOT_PAYMENT`           | Operation 0 is not a payment                                                    |
| 6   | `FORWARD_OP0_ASSET_NOT_NATIVE`      | The payment asset is not native XLM                                             |
| 7   | `FORWARD_OP0_SOURCE_NOT_MEDIATOR`   | Operation 0 has a source that is not the mediator                               |
| 8   | `FORWARD_OP1_NOT_ACCOUNT_MERGE`     | Operation 1 is not an account merge                                             |
| 9   | `FORWARD_OP1_SOURCE_NOT_MEDIATOR`   | Operation 1 has a source that is not the mediator                               |
| 10  | `FORWARD_DESTINATION_MISMATCH`      | The two operations target different destinations                                |
| 11  | `FORWARD_DESTINATION_NOT_COMMITTED` | The destination differs from the one in the flow token                          |
| 12  | `MISSING_TIME_BOUNDS`               | Time bounds absent, or `maxTime` absent, empty, zero, or not a positive integer |
| 13  | `TIME_BOUNDS_EXCESSIVE`             | `maxTime` is more than 3600 seconds in the future                               |

An operation source that is simply omitted inherits the transaction source and is accepted;
only a source that is present and _different_ is rejected.

`MISSING_TIME_BOUNDS` is emitted from two places with two different reason strings, so
there are 13 codes across 14 rejection sites.

Check order: parse, fee-bump, transaction source, operation count, op0 type, op0 asset, op0
source, op1 type, op1 source, destination match, destination committed, time bounds
present, time bounds horizon. Note that all destination binding is verified before time
bounds.

## What a compromised server can do

If the validator passes, the derived key can do exactly what the envelope already spells
out: send the funds to the destination committed in the flow token. That destination is the
one chosen before the flow was minted.

A fully compromised server still cannot redirect funds elsewhere.

## Interrupted forwards

When a close merges into the mediator but the forward does not complete, a recovery record
lets the app offer a **Resume the forward** action on the next visit with that account
connected.
