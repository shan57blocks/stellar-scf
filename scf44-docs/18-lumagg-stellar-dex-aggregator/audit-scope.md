# Smart contract audit — scope & budget (Tranche 3)

**Grant line item:** **$16,000** (external firm or Stellar audit bank + remediation engineering).  
**Target completion:** Oct 1, 2026 (per [scf-resubmission-budget.md](./scf-resubmission-budget.md)).

## Contracts in scope

| Contract | Mainnet ID | Critical paths |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Aggregator** | `CC6QAV7JEG5MYRSPO5Z65E5G2M4ZB64BEG2ZXIZXL55TQT35JDI2LC6K` | `swap`, `split_swap`, `round_trip_swap`; DEX CPI; event emission |
| **Arb vault** | `CCQQ3LRFCSGOYSSD6S4MGH6RWWYVDHYPJO6KYDJYC2IDZK4OGCK6P6KN` | `execute_round_trip`, caller allowlist, `deposit`, `admin_withdraw`, CPI to aggregator |
| **Order Escrow** | **Testnet only; no mainnet ID**<br>Current testnet: `CCI3U3P7MPZNCA5L7KWTXNS7H7KV6AIZQ6ZY2FEOZPHTJIAVCRYPKXTM` | `create_limit`, `fill`, `create_dca`, `fill_dca`, cancellation/refund paths, restricted venue registry |

Source: `contracts/aggregator/`, `contracts/vault/`, `contracts/order-escrow/`.

Order Escrow is included in the review scope only if Limit/DCA is intended for
mainnet. Until that review is complete, it must remain testnet-only. Its
caller-visible validation and lifecycle branches now use the stable
`EscrowError` codes documented in [order-escrow-errors.md](./order-escrow-errors.md);
the audit should verify that these errors do not weaken authorization, refund,
or restricted-venue guarantees before any mainnet deployment.

## Out of scope (unless bundled)

- Off-chain `crates/arbitrage` (Rust bot — not on-chain)
- `api-server` / `market-data-worker`
- Third-party DEX contracts (Aquarius, Soroswap, etc.)

If Limit/DCA remains testnet-only, Order Escrow is excluded from the mainnet
release audit but should still receive a separate testnet security review.

## What $16k typically buys

For **two or three Soroban WASM contracts** with CPI and fund flow:

| Item | Rough range (USD) |
|------|-------------------|
| Focused review (1 auditor, ~1–2 weeks) | **$12k – $18k** |
| Full dual-contract + remediation support | **$16k – $25k** |
| Three-contract review including Order Escrow | **$20k – $30k+** |
| Big-4 / top-tier firm | **$30k+** |

The **$16k grant allocation** is realistic for:

- Stellar-ecosystem auditors (e.g. firms that have done Soroban/SDF-adjacent work)
- **Stellar Community Fund audit bank** / panel-recommended vendors (if available for awarded projects)
- Scope limited to **aggregator + vault** (not entire monorepo), unless Limit/DCA is moving to mainnet

Remediation (fix + re-audit critical/high) is included in the grant line — budget **~2–4 XLM WASM uploads** (~$20 XLM each on mainnet) separately from auditor fee.

## How to engage

1. Freeze WASM versions post–Tranche 2 arb stack (tag commit + WASM hashes).
2. Send RFP with this doc + repo link + mainnet IDs.
3. Ask for: threat model, CPI/auth review, economic attacks (slippage, caller abuse), report + retest of fixes.
4. Record: engagement letter, final PDF, remediation tx hashes.

## Suggested vendors to quote

- Stellar-focused boutiques (search “Soroban smart contract audit”)
- SCF / Stellar Foundation partner lists when award is active
- Get **2 quotes** — one at ~$12k focused, one at ~$20k full — to validate $16k envelope

## If quotes exceed $16k

- Narrow scope: vault first (smaller, arb funds at risk), aggregator second tranche
- Or self-fund delta; do not reduce aggregator CPI review depth
