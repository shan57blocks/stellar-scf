# SCF Build - Tranche 1 Completion Form Draft

Prepared for the **July 31, 2026** deadline. Replace every `TODO` before
submitting. Keep the video public or unlisted and verify all links in a private
browser window.

## Form selections

- **Submission:** LumAgg - Stellar DEX Aggregator (SCF #44)
- **Ready to submit:** Yes, after the pre-submit checklist below is complete
- **Project stage:** Pre-Launch #1 - MVP
- **Telegram username:** `@ligulfzhou` (use the exact Telegram handle only)

## Tranche Deliverables

LumAgg completed all four approved Tranche 1 deliverables:

**1. Execution evidence and venue differentiation pack.** We published a
reproducible benchmark covering at least three pairs and three sizes, including
fair Soroban-only comparisons using `prefer_soroban=1`, Aquarius CLMM routes,
and documented split-routing cases. The benchmark script can be rerun locally,
and the comparison document cites the public Stellar Broker adapter coverage.

**2. Integrator-ready API.** We published an OpenAPI specification and a
docs-only integrator guide covering `/quote`, `/build_tx`, `/tokens`, balances,
health, partner API keys, and rate limits. The live `/quote` endpoint supports
`prefer_soroban=1`. A non-founder external tester used their own funded public
G-address and ran the documented one-command smoke test
(`OUT=./output USER_G=G... ./scripts/integrator-smoke.sh`). The script completed
the health, quote, and unsigned transaction-build flow and saved the request and
responses. The captured quote is a split Soroswap plus Aquarius CLMM route, and
the `build_tx` response contains a valid unsigned transaction XDR. No secret key,
signature, or on-chain submission was required.

**3. Completed swap UI.** The production UI now provides token metadata and
self-hosted logos with deterministic fallbacks, connected-wallet spendable
balances, 25% / 50% / 75% / 100% quick amount controls with an XLM reserve,
configurable slippage, Max hops and Max splits routing controls, and a Stellar
Expert transaction link after submission. Max hops limits route length, while
Max splits limits the number of parallel routes considered. The live token API
currently returns metadata/logo coverage for more than 50 routable tokens, and
the responsive quote-to-build-to-sign flow remains live on mainnet.

**4. On-chain analytics indexer v0.** A production indexer ingests LumAgg
Aggregator contract events from Stellar mainnet and stores daily time-series
for transaction count, entry notional, unique users, function breakdown,
split/round-trip activity, and per-leg DEX attribution across Aquarius,
Soroswap, Phoenix, Sushi, and Comet. We published the attribution specification,
sample export, public `/api/v1/stats` endpoint, CSV export, and public stats page
for continued data collection toward the Tranche 3 30-day report.

## Support Needed

We would appreciate introductions to Stellar wallets and dApps interested in
testing LumAgg's REST API or TypeScript SDK, and guidance on engaging a
Stellar/Soroban-focused auditor for the approved Tranche 3 Aggregator and Vault
audit. No blocker currently prevents continued development.

## Product Testing

- **Product URL:** https://lumagg.xyz
- **Documentation:** https://lumagg.xyz/docs
- **Network:** Stellar Public Network (mainnet)
- **Credentials:** No credentials are required for normal public API testing.
  Partner API keys only increase rate limits.
- **Suggested test:** Connect Freighter, select XLM to USDC, enter a small
  amount, inspect the returned route, and build/sign the transaction. A USDC
  trustline is required before receiving classic-backed USDC.
- **Non-signing API test:** Run the repository's `scripts/integrator-smoke.sh`
  with a funded public G-address. It builds an unsigned XDR and does not require
  a secret key or transaction submission.

## Tranche 1 Video Script (5 minutes maximum)

### 0:00-0:25 - Scope

- Show the LumAgg home/swap page.
- State that Tranche 1 covers differentiation evidence, integrator API
  readiness, swap UI completion, and analytics indexer v0.

### 0:25-1:15 - Benchmark and differentiation

- Open `docs/scf-benchmark-results.md`.
- Show the three pairs and multiple sizes.
- Highlight one fair XLM-to-USDC comparison, one `is_split=true` result, and an
  Aquarius CLMM route.
- Briefly show `scripts/scf-benchmark.sh` to establish reproducibility.

### 1:15-2:25 - Integrator-ready API

  `unsigned_tx_xdr`; do not scroll through the full XDR.

- Open https://lumagg.xyz/stats.
- Show daily notional, transaction count, function breakdown, and DEX legs.
- Open `/api/v1/stats?format=csv` and mention that indexing continues toward
  the Tranche 3 30-day report.
