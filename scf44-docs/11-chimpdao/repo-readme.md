# Chi//mp: physical-backed tokens on Stellar

Chi//mp links a Stellar non-fungible token (NFT) to a single physical object
through an NFC chip embedded in the object. The chip generates its own
elliptic-curve key pair in tamper-resistant silicon, the private key never
leaves the chip, and an ECDSA signature from the chip authorises every
state-changing call on the NFT. The repository serves both as a deployed
Stellar mainnet system and as a reproducible reference implementation for
studying hardware-anchored authorisation on a non-EVM ledger.

## What this is

Production systems that tie a physical object to a digital identifier through
an NFC chip either keep a chip identifier in a custodial database (vulnerable
to cloning of identifier-only tags) or live on Ethereum-compatible chains
(ERC-5791 / Chiru Labs PBT). Stellar previously had no open-source equivalent.
Chi//mp provides one: Soroban contracts that treat an on-chip ECDSA signature
as the authoritative credential for NFTs and per-chip Pocket accounts, plus
an example app that locks tokens under a chip public key.

|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`contracts/nfc-nft/`](contracts/nfc-nft)       | SEP-50 NFT contract; every mutator requires a chip attestation for that exact call. |
| [`contracts/collection/`](contracts/collection) | Factory that deploys NFC-NFT contracts and indexes ownership across them.           |
| [`contracts/account/`](contracts/account) | **Chimp account** — the durable root; a flat set of cards, any one of which signs. |
| [`contracts/pocket/`](contracts/pocket) | **Pocket** — per-card purse; a Soroban custom account keyed by the chip. |
| [`contracts/pocket-factory/`](contracts/pocket-factory) | Deploys Pocket accounts (`salt = sha256(pubkey)`). |
| [`contracts/chip-auth/`](contracts/chip-auth) | Shared k1 + r1 IntAuth verification (rlib, linked not deployed). |
| [`examples/prize/`](examples/prize)             | Example app: per-chip token vault (not core protocol).                              |
| [`Makefile`](Makefile)                          | Build, test, deploy and admin targets.                                              |

Administration lives in **chimpdao-terminal** (card setup, mint, claim) and in the
Makefile (deploy, `contract_clawback`). The repo previously carried a second React admin
`dapp/`; it was superseded by the terminal and is removed.

### Accounts, purses and cards

The durable account is the **Chimp account**: a flat set of cards where any one of them
can sign (1-of-n), and a card's 65-byte public key *is* its identity. That is what makes
a card replaceable — losing one is `remove_card` + `add_card`, not losing the balance.
There is no rule, policy or signer-id layer, and no OpenZeppelin.

**Pocket** is the per-card purse: the float for fast taps *and* the card's DeFi
positions, so giving a loaded card away needs no unwind — the purse travels with it. It
stores the owning Chimp account so that account can `sweep` a lost card.

```bash
make contract_build
make contract_test
make contract_deploy_all       # fresh network only — never mainnet
```

`contract_deploy_all` runs the pieces in dependency order. Two wiring steps are easy to
miss when running targets by hand: `contract_configure_factory` pins the Pocket wasm hash
the factory may deploy, and `contract_set_factory` points nfc-nft back at the factory —
without which a card handover silently leaves the purse behind.

Auth: Pocket and the Chimp account both implement `CustomAccountInterface` and both sign
the **same** host-computed payload, so the host binds each signature to the exact call.
There is no Pocket `transfer` entry point and no app-level nonce. Only the envelope
differs — a purse has one card, an account has a set and the signature names which one.
Details in [`docs/AUTH.md`](docs/AUTH.md).

The NFC hardware bridge lives in **[chimpdao-nfc-bridge](https://radicle.network/nodes/radicle.consulting-manao.com/rad%3Az2CDTfvUguLG3UboK46HyYxoxg1og)**; the merchant POS in **[chimpdao-terminal](https://radicle.network/nodes/radicle.consulting-manao.com/rad%3Az4Y793TkQB4X4Uz4CRdEMUHxakZKt)** (Radicle repos under consulting-manao).

The full chip-integration guide is in [`README_NFC.md`](README_NFC.md). The
mobile tap-to-claim flow lives in a companion iOS application.

# NFC Chip Integration Guide

Using Infineon SECORA and NXP MIFARE DUOX chips with the Stellar contracts: mint, claim and transfer NFTs with hardware-backed signatures.

| **chimpdao-contracts** | this repo | Soroban contracts |

```bash
git clone https://radicle.consulting-manao.com/z2CDTfvUguLG3UboK46HyYxoxg1og.git chimpdao-nfc-bridge
```

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: Infineon SECORA chip + Identiv/uTrust USB reader
- **Software**: Node.js ≥ 22 for the bridge; Bun for the terminal
- **Wallet**: Freighter or compatible Stellar wallet

## Running

```bash
# Terminal 1: NFC bridge (Node only — not Bun)
cd chimpdao-nfc-bridge
npm install && npm start

# Terminal 2: the POS
cd ../chimpdao-terminal
bun install && bun run dev
```

Card setup — purse, mint, assign, tag link — is **Set up a card** in the terminal.

If the chip was already on the reader when the bridge started, **lift and retap**.

## Architecture

```
Browser ← WebSocket → chimpdao-nfc-bridge ← nfc-pcsc → USB Reader ← NFC → Chip
```

Protocol: `status` | `read-pubkey` | `sign` | `read-ndef` | `write-ndef` | `generate-key` | `fetch-key`

Full spec: [chimpdao-nfc-bridge/docs/PROTOCOL.md](https://radicle.consulting-manao.com/z2CDTfvUguLG3UboK46HyYxoxg1og.git) (clone the bridge repo).

### Stellar flow

The client no longer builds its own message — the digest the chip signs is derived from
the call itself, so a signature cannot be moved to a different one.

**Pocket (the chip is the account):**

1. Read the chip public key (65-byte SEC1)
2. Build the operation (e.g. a SAC `transfer`) and simulate it
3. Take the host's authorization payload from the prepared auth entry
4. Chip signs that 32-byte payload
5. Recover the recovery id (`@noble/secp256k1`), inject `ChipAuth` as the credential
6. Re-simulate in `enforce` mode so the footprint covers `__check_auth`, then submit

**nfc-nft (the chip is a presence proof beside a wallet):**

1. Read the chip public key and the chip's nonce on the contract
2. Build `call_digest(domain, contract, fn, args, nonce)` — see `src/chain/chip-auth.ts`
3. Chip signs it; submit alongside the wallet's own authorization

A cross-client test pins the TypeScript `callDigest` against the Rust implementation; if
they ever diverge every attestation is rejected on-chain with an opaque contract error.

### Merchant terminal (XRPL)

```bash
git clone https://radicle.consulting-manao.com/z4Y793TkQB4X4Uz4CRdEMUHxakZKt.git chimpdao-terminal
```

## Signature format

- **From chip**: DER-encoded ECDSA
- **From bridge**: `r` + `s` as 32-byte hex (low-S)
- **Terminal**: `chipAuthForDigest()` in `src/chain/chip-auth.ts`

Contract tests cover digest construction and rejection paths only; a valid signature is
proven on live hardware, not simulated. `cargo test -p chimpdao-chip-auth` pins the
digest the terminal must reproduce.
