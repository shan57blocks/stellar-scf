## What is LumenWipe?

LumenWipe is an open-source, non-custodial web app that walks you through closing a Stellar account from start to finish - automatically. It detects everything holding your account open (trustlines, DEX offers, DeFi positions, data entries, extra signers), unwinds it step by step, converts leftover tokens to XLM, and merges the account into your destination wallet or exchange address.

**The API builds every unsigned transaction; the browser verifies it against your own choices and signs it. Your private keys never leave your device.** The API holds no user keys and can never move your funds.

> **Status:** the classic account wind-down runs today on testnet and mainnet. Soroban & DeFi protocol exits, the allowance inspector, and sponsored fees are in active development - see the [roadmap](#delivery-roadmap).

---

## The Problem

Stellar has over **10 million accounts on mainnet**, and a large share are stale, abandoned, or locked. Two structural issues cause this:

**1. Every account locks XLM in reserve.** The minimum balance is 1 XLM (two base reserves of 0.5 XLM), and each trustline, open offer, data entry, or extra signer adds another 0.5 XLM. An account with four trustlines, two offers, one data entry, and one extra signer locks **5 XLM** that cannot be spent until each entry is individually removed.

**2. Closing an account manually is hard.** A single leftover subentry causes the final `ACCOUNT_MERGE` to fail. Users must cancel every offer, exit every DeFi position, sell every asset, remove every trustline, and clear every data entry - in the correct order - before the merge succeeds. Miss one and everything reverts.

**Exchanges compound the problem.** No major exchange supports `ACCOUNT_MERGE`. Sending remaining XLM to a CEX deposit address still leaves the 1 XLM minimum balance permanently locked. LumenWipe solves this with a shared mediator account and an atomic forwarding payment.

**DeFi users have no tool at all.** The existing demolisher has no Soroban support. Any account with a Blend loan, an Aquarius LP position, or a Soroswap pair share cannot be closed with existing tools.

---

## Architecture

The system has three layers. The trust boundary is the browser: it verifies every transaction and signs it; keys never leave the client.

![System architecture diagram](docs/diagrams/output/01-system-architecture.svg)

**Browser (trust boundary)** - The guided UI, wallet adapter, and `verify()` (the trust anchor) live in the browser. It fetches unsigned transactions from the API through a key-injecting server-side proxy, verifies each one against the user's own choices before signing, signs locally, and submits back through the API. The session is persisted to IndexedDB; keys are never stored.

**API service** - A stateless NestJS service, and the product itself: it reads account state, detects DeFi positions, quotes routes, and builds the minimal set of unsigned transactions that close an account. It holds no user keys and is not in the signing path; its one signing key co-signs only the mediator's forward payment. A fully compromised API still cannot move funds, because `verify()` refuses to sign anything that does not match the user's intent.

**Stellar network and data services** - Stellar RPC for live reads, simulation, submission, and events; one Horizon-compatible endpoint for subentry enumeration; Soroswap Aggregator API for conversion routing; OctoPos for DeFi position detection.

**Key design decisions:**

- **No bespoke indexer.** Stellar RPC cannot enumerate unknown subentries, so enumeration comes from one Horizon-compatible endpoint set by configuration. LumenWipe re-reads exact on-chain state over RPC immediately before building each transaction, and never signs based on stale data.
- **Pluggable data sources.** Every read source (RPC provider, indexer, routing API, DeFi position API) is behind an adapter, so any compatible provider can be swapped in without touching the transaction logic.
- **Soroban exits are simulated before signing.** Every `InvokeHostFunction` is run through `simulateTransaction` to fill in footprint, authorization, and resource fees. The user sees the simulation result before being asked to sign.

---

## How It Works

### Execution plan

LumenWipe builds a **deterministic, ordered execution plan** from the account's live state. The same account state always produces the same plan - which makes it auditable and unit-testable. Steps are reconciled against on-chain state on resume, so an interrupted session never double-executes a completed step.

![Ordered execution plan](docs/diagrams/output/06-execution-plan.svg)

| Step                               | Operation                               | Details                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Normalize signers**           | `SetOptions`                            | Removes extra signers, normalizes thresholds to 0/1/1 so a single key can authorize all remaining steps |
| **2. Remove data entries**         | `ManageData`                            | Clears all `ManageData` entries in batches of 100                                                       |
| **3. Claim claimable balances**    | `ClaimClaimableBalance`                 | Optional; claims any claimable balances before conversion                                               |
| **4. Cancel DEX offers**           | `ManageSellOffer` / `ManageBuyOffer`    | Sets amount to 0 on all open order-book offers, freeing reserves                                        |
| **5. Withdraw AMM & LP positions** | `LiquidityPoolWithdraw` + Soroban calls | Classic CAP-38 pools and all supported Soroban protocol exits                                           |
| **6. Exit DeFi protocols**         | Soroban `InvokeHostFunction`            | Blend, Phoenix, FxDAO: repay debt then withdraw collateral                                              |
| **7. Convert assets**              | `PathPaymentStrictSend` / Soroban swaps | Every non-XLM balance converted to XLM via the best available route                                     |
| **8. Remove trustlines**           | `ChangeTrust` (limit 0)                 | Removes all trustlines once their balances are zero, batched by 100                                     |
| **9. Merge account**               | `AccountMerge`                          | Direct merge, or via mediator account for exchange destinations                                         |

### Session state machine

The entire wind-down is held as an explicit state machine persisted to IndexedDB. Users can close the tab at any point and resume - completed steps are skipped, never re-executed.

![Demolish flow state machine](docs/diagrams/output/03-state-machine.svg)

### Signing flow

Every step follows the same pattern: the API builds the unsigned envelope → present for review → `verify()` against the user's intent → sign in browser → submit via the API → poll to confirmation → advance.

![Transaction signing flow](docs/diagrams/output/04-signing-flow.svg)

### CEX mediator flow

Exchanges don't support `ACCOUNT_MERGE`. LumenWipe routes the merge through a shared mediator account in a single atomic transaction sequence:

![Mediator flow for exchange destinations](docs/diagrams/output/09-mediator-flow.svg)

The mediator is a persistent account funded once by the operator and reused for every close. You recover essentially all of your XLM; only standard network fees apply. The API builds the transaction, `verify()` confirms the merge goes to the shared mediator, and your browser signs the merge half. The API co-signs only the mediator's forward payment, after validating the exact transaction shape, and cannot alter the destination or amount. Known exchange destinations are validated against a registry that enforces the correct memo type - a missing memo blocks submission.

---

## Supported DeFi Protocols

LumenWipe detects and unwinds positions across the major Soroban DeFi protocols using [OctoPos](https://communityfund.stellar.org/project/octopos-defi-position-api-g6i) as the DeFi Position API.

![DeFi adapter and fallback logic](docs/diagrams/output/05-defi-adapter-fallback.svg)

| Protocol        | Position type                               | Exit mechanism                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Classic DEX** | Order-book offers                           | `ManageSellOffer` / `ManageBuyOffer` (amount = 0)                   |
| **Classic AMM** | Pool-share trustline (CAP-38)               | `LiquidityPoolWithdraw`                                             |
| **Blend**       | Supply (bToken), borrow (dToken), backstop  | `Pool.submit` - repay then withdraw, via `@blend-capital/blend-sdk` |
| **Aquarius**    | AMM LP, AQUA rewards                        | `withdraw`, `claim` via Aquarius contracts                          |
| **Soroswap**    | AMM LP                                      | `remove_liquidity` via Soroswap Router API                          |
| **Phoenix**     | AMM LP, optional stake                      | `withdraw_liquidity`, `unstake` first if staked                     |
| **FxDAO**       | CDP vault (XLM collateral, stablecoin debt) | `pay_debt` then collateral withdrawal                               |

If the DeFi position provider is unavailable, the tool enters **degraded mode**: classic entries process normally and the user is warned to verify DeFi positions manually. The flow never silently fails or skips a position.

### Asset conversion routing

![Asset conversion and routing](docs/diagrams/output/08-asset-conversion-routing.svg)

All non-XLM balances are converted using the best available route: the Soroswap Aggregator API (which spans both Soroban AMMs and the classic SDEX), with SDEX path payments as the fallback. Every conversion is quoted, slippage-bounded, and simulated before the user is asked to sign.

## Security Model

LumenWipe builds transactions that drain accounts irreversibly. The security design starts from that fact.

| What                      | How it's protected                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Private key**           | Never transmitted. Wallet path keeps it in the wallet; advanced secret-key mode keeps it in memory only, cleared after each signing operation              |
| **API-built transaction** | Verified client-side against the user's own choices before signing (`verify()`); the browser never signs bytes it did not verify                           |
| **Destination address**   | Full-address display, ledger existence check, and explicit confirmation before merge                                                                       |
| **Exchange memo**         | Required and validated for known exchange destinations - missing memos block submission                                                                    |
| **API compromise**        | Cannot move funds: `verify()` checks every transaction against the user's own inputs, never the API's response, so a diverting transaction is never signed |
| **XSS**                   | Strict Content Security Policy - no inline scripts, no `unsafe-eval`                                                                                       |
| **Supply chain**          | Lockfile-pinned dependencies, audited in CI                                                                                                                |

The codebase undergoes internal security reviews as part of the development process. External security audits will be conducted when possible.

---

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3+

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/LumenWipe/lumenwipe.git
cd lumenwipe
bun install

# Run in development (testnet by default) - the full flow needs BOTH services
bun run dev:api      # NestJS API (localhost:3001)
bun dev              # web (localhost:3000), reaches the API through its proxy
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The tool defaults to Stellar testnet - no real funds are at risk while developing.

### Environment variables

The web and the API each read their own `.env.local` (copy from each app's `.env.example`).

**`apps/api/.env.local`** - the API:

| Variable                                            | Description                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `API_KEYS`                                          | Accepted API keys as `label=key` (the web's key must be listed here)          |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_RPC_TESTNET` / `_MAINNET`      | Stellar RPC endpoints                                                         |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PATH_ROUTING_API_TESTNET` / `_MAINNET` | Horizon-compatible endpoints for offers, full account state, and path finding |
| `MEDIATOR_SECRET_TESTNET` / `_MAINNET`              | Shared mediator secret (operator-only; enables exchange closes)               |

**`apps/web/.env.local`** - the web:

| Variable                                           | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LUMENWIPE_API_URL` / `LUMENWIPE_API_KEY`          | API base URL and key, injected server-side by the proxy (never sent to the browser) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIATOR_PUBLIC_TESTNET` / `_MAINNET` | Public key of the shared mediator, so `verify()` can recognize the merge target     |
| `KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`            | Vercel KV - for the merge-stats counter and the proxy rate limit                    |

### Running tests

```bash
# Unit tests
bun run test

# End-to-end tests (Playwright, against testnet)
bun run test:e2e

# Type check
bun run type-check
```

## Delivery Roadmap

The project is delivered in three cumulative tranches, each independently verifiable:

| Tranche                      | Focus                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Status          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **1 - Classic MVP**          | Full classic wind-down on testnet: signer normalization, data entries, offer cancellation, classic liquidity pool withdrawal, asset conversion, trustline removal, merge, mediator flow, multisig, session recovery | **In progress** |
| **2 - Soroban & DeFi**       | DeFi position detection via OctoPos; Blend, Aquarius, Soroswap, Phoenix, and FxDAO exits; Soroban token conversion; allowance inspector; per-step simulation; sponsored fees for reserve-locked accounts            | Planned         |
| **3 - Production hardening** | Security review and remediation, performance validation, final UX from user testing, complete public documentation, public REST API and TypeScript SDK for integrators                                              | Planned         |

> The classic wind-down already runs. The API builds the classic transactions, the browser verifies and signs them, and the tool executes the full path - signer normalization, offer cancellation, asset conversion, trustline removal, and `AccountMerge` including the mediator flow - on both testnet and mainnet.
