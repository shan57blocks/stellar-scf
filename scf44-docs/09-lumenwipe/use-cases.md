# Use cases

> Who closes Stellar accounts, and what they recover when they do.

Every Stellar account holds XLM it cannot spend: a 1 XLM minimum balance (two base reserves), plus 0.5 XLM for each trustline, offer, data entry, and extra signer. That XLM comes back only when the account closes cleanly, and a clean close is exactly what LumenWipe does, whether through the guided web app or programmatically through the REST API and TypeScript SDK.

The audiences below all end up at the same `ACCOUNT_MERGE`, but they arrive from very different places.

## Building an integration?

Embedding the wind-down in another product does not change who holds the keys: signing always happens with your own infrastructure, and LumenWipe never touches funds. If you are considering an integration, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/LumenWipe/lumenwipe) and we will help you scope it.
