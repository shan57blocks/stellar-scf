Products & Services
Emerging markets, particularly across Sub Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, are experiencing rapid adoption of USD backed stablecoins to combat hyperinflation and local currency devaluation. However, standard cryptocurrency wallets and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols remain inaccessible to average users due to significant technical friction:
Seed Phrase Anxiety
: Managing twelve word recovery phrases represents a major single point of failure for non technical users.
Gas Fee Complexity
: Requiring users to hold native tokens (like XLM, SOL, or ETH) simply to pay network fees for a stablecoin transaction creates immediate drop offs.
Fragmented Financial Flows
: Users are forced to switch between multiple apps, off ramps, neobanks, and DeFi protocols just to receive, swap, save, or spend stablecoins.
Jumpa
 resolves this friction by introducing a
premium, chat native multi chain wallet interface
 that lets users spend stablecoins like physical cash. Powered by
AI
, Jumpa translates natural language requests (e.g.,
"Swap 50 XLM for USDC,"
"Deposit $20 into my savings goal,"
 or
"I want to cash in 50 USDC"
) into instant, on chain execution payloads.
By utilizing a
sovereign security model
 (client side AES 256 GCM encryption secured by a 6 digit PIN) and
gas abstraction
, Jumpa delivers a truly frictionless chat experience that hides blockchain complexity under a conversational interface.
How Stellar is Used (Ecosystem Integrations)
Jumpa operates as a multi chain wallet gateway. Under the
SCF Integration Track
, Jumpa will directly integrate
four key building blocks from the official SCF Integration List
 into its core Next.js/React architecture:
A. Soroswap Aggregator API (Stellar Swaps)
Instead of building custom swap smart contracts, Jumpa will integrate the
Soroswap API
 directly into our conversational loop:
Intent Parsing
: When a user inputs a swap request via chat (
"Swap 100 XLM for USDC"
), the AI assistant parses the token symbols and amount into a structured payload.
Quote & Build
: The Jumpa backend calls the Soroswap Quote API to retrieve the best aggregated route across Soroswap, Phoenix, and the classic Stellar DEX, then calls the Build API to retrieve the unsigned Transaction XDR.
On device Signing
: The transaction is decrypted and signed locally on device using the user's derived Stellar Keypair, then securely broadcast to Horizon.
B. MoneyGram Access & Mercuryo (SEP 24 Hosted Ramps)
Instead of attempting to construct banking rails from scratch, Jumpa will integrate
MoneyGram
 (for physical cash in and cash out) and
Mercuryo
 (for card payments) using the Stellar standard
SEP 24
 (Hosted Deposit & Withdrawal) and
SEP 10
 (Authentication):
Interactive Sessions
: When a user requests an on ramp or off ramp via chat, Jumpa initiates a secure transaction with the respective anchor server and retrieves the interactive URL.
Seamless Overlay UI
: The interactive portal is opened in a sleek, overlay sheet (
OnrampSheet
/
OfframpSheet
) using an iframe, allowing the user to complete payment natively without leaving the chat interface.
C. DeFindex Yield Infrastructure (Savings Goals)
Jumpa features a native
Target Savings
 module. Rather than keeping savings static, Jumpa will integrate
DeFindex
 (Yield Infrastructure for Stellar):
Yield bearing Savings
: When a user deposits stablecoins into a savings goal via chat, the backend routes the deposit into decentralized DeFindex yield bearing pools on Stellar.
Auto harvesting
: Yield is tracked and displayed to the user in real time, allowing them to preserve purchasing power against high inflation local currencies.
D. Allbridge (Cross Chain Bridging)
Since Jumpa is a unified multi chain interface supporting Solana, Base, and Stellar, cross chain interoperability is crucial. Jumpa will integrate the
Allbridge SDK/Widget
 to allow users to seamlessly bridge stablecoins between Solana/Base and Stellar directly within the transaction confirmation drawer
How This Integration Improves Jumpa
Low Cost & Speed
: Integrating Stellar as a core payment corridor provides Jumpa users with near instant (3 to 5 seconds) transaction settlement and sub penny fees.
Gas Abstraction
: By leveraging Stellar's low fees, Jumpa can fully abstract gas. Users pay transaction fees in the asset being transferred (like USDC), while Jumpa handles the XLM network fees on the backend.
Absolute Compliance
: Integrating official Stellar anchor standards (SEP 10, SEP 24) ensures built in compliance, tiered KYC, and trusted transaction monitoring.
Highly Credible UX
: Replacing an overly ambitious roadmap with proven ecosystem integrations allows a lean team to deliver a production ready Web3 application within a competitive time
Requested Budget
$89.7K
Traction Evidence

87 active testers
, facilitating
450+ mainnet transactions
 and driving over
$3,000 in volume
.

Merchant Integration Pipeline
: Secured early expressions of interest (MoU) with
12 local merchants
 across Nigeria, Kenya, and Thailand to integrate Jumpa's automated stablecoin payouts.
This early momentum validates strong demand for a simple, chat-first stablecoin spending solution
Tranche 1 (Deliverable Roadmap) - MVP
Tranche 1: Core Integration & SDK Foundations
Brief Description: Establish the core integration layer for the Stellar Horizon connector, the Soroswap REST API, and hosted SEP 24 sandbox environments on Next.js/React.
Milestones & Deliverables:
Stellar Key Derivation: Standardize sovereign client side key derivation (BIP39 path m/44'/148'/0') with @stellar/stellar-sdk and active Horizon testnet/mainnet account state sync.
Soroswap Backend Integrator: Implement backend service handlers in Next.js to fetch quotes from /quote and construct transaction XDR envelopes from /build for testnet XLM/USDC pools.
SEP 24 Hosted Ramps Staging: Embed the Mercuryo and MoneyGram testnet SEP 24 sandbox interactive environment within responsive frontend Sheets (OnrampSheet/OfframpSheet) via iframes.
AI Intent Upgrades: Update the AI based natural language intent engine to parse, map, and output structured Stellar swap, deposit, and withdraw payloads.
How to Measure Completion:
Deliverable 1: A screen captured video showing a user typing a Stellar swap request into the chat, the AI fetching an active quote from Soroswap on testnet, and displaying the transaction parameters.
Deliverable 2: Successful initialization of a sandboxed SEP 24 on ramp interactive window inside Jumpa's UI Sheet, loaded using testnet parameters.
Budget: $30,000
Tranche 2 (Deliverable Roadmap) - Testnet
Conversational Loop & DeFi Yield Staging
Brief Description
: Complete the end to end conversational transaction loops on Stellar testnet and integrate the DeFindex yield savings module.
Milestones & Deliverables
:
End to end chat swaps
: Enable full Soroswap token swaps directly in the chat interface on testnet (AI quote to backend XDR build to client side signature decryption via PIN to Horizon broadcast).
Savings Yield Integration
: Wire Jumpa's Target Savings frontend module to DeFindex testnet pools, demonstrating automated USDC deposits and mock yield tracking.
Cross Chain Bridging
: Integrate Allbridge testnet support into the unified transaction confirmation drawer, allowing simulated Base to Stellar stablecoin transfers.
How to Measure Completion
:
Deliverable 1
: A screen captured video showing a complete testnet swap cycle: the user initiates a swap in chat, inputs their 6 digit PIN to sign the transaction, and the backend successfully submits the transaction to Horizon (with transaction hash logs).
Deliverable 2
: Working mockups and logs demonstrating testnet deposits and withdrawals into DeFindex yield pools from the savings dashboard.
Budget
: $26,700
Tranche 3 (Deliverable Roadmap) - Mainnet
Production Mainnet Launch
Brief Description
: Deploy all four integrations to the Jumpa production environment on Stellar mainnet and verify the audit trail.
Milestones & Deliverables
:
Mainnet Deployments
: Push Soroswap, DeFindex yield, Allbridge, and MoneyGram/Mercuryo live on the Jumpa production web application.
Public Documentation
: Publish comprehensive user and developer guides detailing Jumpa's integration architecture, key derivation path, and data privacy safeguards on the official Jumpa website.
On chain verification
: Ensure 100% of all mainnet transaction histories are publicly audit verifiable via the Stellar Expert explorer.
How to Measure Completion (Mainnet Metrics)
:
Metric 1
: At least
50 real cross border or swap transactions
 successfully settled on Stellar mainnet.
Metric 2
: A minimum of
$5000 in total value
 successfully swapped or bridged on mainnet.
Metric 3

Budget
: $33,000
