## 1. Executive Summary

Tranche 2 transitions Jumpa from initial SDK integrations into **fully closed, autonomous non-custodial financial transaction loops**. Users can execute end-to-end conversational token swaps directly inside the chat interface using **Soroswap DEX routing** on the Stellar testnet, deploy and fund automated yield-bearing savings goals through **DeFindex Soroban smart contract vaults**, and bridge stablecoins between **Base Sepolia and Stellar** using **Allbridge Core** quoting inside the unified PIN confirmation drawer.

```

## 3. Milestone 1: End-to-End Chat Swaps via Soroswap Router

Conversational swaps are executed seamlessly from natural language input to final on-chain settlement on the Stellar testnet via Soroban smart contract invocations.

### 3.1 Conversational Intent & On-Chain Soroswap Quoting
The AI system prompt interprets natural language intent for token swaps, extracting parameters via structured function calling (`stellar_testnet_swap_quote`). Quotes are queried **directly on-chain** against the **Soroswap Router smart contract** via Soroban RPC simulation (`router_get_amounts_out`), ensuring pricing is anchored in real-time liquidity pool reserves:
- **Soroswap Router Contract:** `CCJUD55AG6W5HAI5LRVNKAE5WDP5XGZBUDS5WNTIVDU7O264UZZE7BRD`
- **XLM SAC Contract:** `CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC`
- **Circle USDC SAC Contract:** `CBIELTK6YBZJU5UP2WWQEUCYKLPU6AUNZ2BQ4WWFEIE3USCIHMXQDAMA`
- **XLM/USDC Pair Contract:** `CCBX3NZTCQLQFSPG7HBOKL4P2RVPOPVFHDNRTOSCCJWBTPL2GHEH7RQS`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No Fabricated Rates:** The hardcoded fallback rate was completely removed. If no on-chain liquidity or orderbook route exists for a pair, the engine throws an explicit `Insufficient liquidity` error, preventing users from signing transactions priced off invented numbers.

### 3.2 Dynamic Quote Card & Inline Editing
An interactive card renders directly within the chat transcript:
- **You Pay:** Numeric input and token badge (`XLM` or `USDC`)
- **You Receive:** Formatted output token amount derived from live on-chain pool reserves
- **Stats:** Live exchange rate, slippage tolerance (`0.5%`), protocol (`Soroswap Router`), and network fee dynamically derived from Soroban RPC `minResourceFee` + `BASE_FEE` (e.g. `0.00144 XLM`).
- **Inline Editing:** Users can edit the input amount directly inside the card, which automatically triggers a debounced live re-quote from the on-chain router.

### 3.3 Authorization, Soroban XDR Construction & Horizon Broadcast
When the user taps **Confirm** and enters their 6-digit PIN:
1. Validates the 6-digit PIN against the encrypted wallet hash.
2. Checks available on-chain balance and ensures the destination asset trustline exists on-chain.
3. Decrypts the user's BIP-39 mnemonic in memory via AES-256-GCM.
4. Derives the sovereign Stellar keypair via derivation path `m/44'/148'/0'`.
5. Constructs the Soroban `invoke_host_function` smart contract transaction calling `swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens(amountIn, amountOutMin, path, recipient, deadline)` on the Soroswap Router contract.
6. Simulates the transaction via Soroban RPC to assemble footprint and authorizations (`assembleTransaction`).
7. Signs the transaction envelope with the decrypted Ed25519 secret key.
8. Submits the signed transaction directly to the Stellar network.
9. Records the transaction under the transaction ledger (`type: "SWAP"`, `status: "CONFIRMED"`, `txHash`).
10. Emits the verified receipt card with a clickable explorer link to Stellar Expert.

---

## 4. Milestone 2: DeFi Savings Yield Integration via DeFindex

Jumpa's Target Savings module connects to **DeFindex**, a non-custodial decentralized index and yield protocol built on Stellar Soroban smart contracts.

### 4.1 DeFindex Protocol Client Implementation
A dedicated REST client provides complete integration with the DeFindex API:
- `createVaultDeposit(params)`: Builds an unsigned Soroban transaction to deploy a vault and deposit initial assets.
- `deposit(vaultAddress, params)`: Builds an unsigned transaction to deposit underlying assets (USDC) into a vault.
- `withdraw(vaultAddress, params)`: Builds an unsigned transaction to redeem vault shares (`dfTokens`) for underlying assets.
- `getBalance(vaultAddress, userAddress)`: Queries real-time vault underlying asset balances (denominated in 7-decimal stroops).
- `getApy(vaultAddress)`: Queries live Net APY generated by underlying yield strategies.
- `send(signedXdr)`: Submits signed Soroban transactions to the Stellar network via DeFindex RPC relay.

### 4.2 Savings Service Layer & State Sync
The savings service bridges database models with on-chain Soroban state:
- `formatPlanForUI(plan, liveBalanceOverride)`: Formats dates, goal targets, days remaining, and progress percentages for UI components.
- `getLiveVaultBalance(vaultAddress, userAddress)`: Concurrently retrieves on-chain underlying token balance and share counts.
- `getLiveVaultApy(vaultAddress)`: Supplies dynamic yield percentages displayed across the savings dashboard.

### 4.3 Automated Deposits & Withdrawals API
Automated routes handle plan lifecycle and blockchain execution:
- Initializes new Target or Locked Savings goals wired to pre-configured testnet vault addresses (`DEFINDEX_INDIVIDUAL_VAULT_ADDRESS` and `DEFINDEX_LOCK_VAULT_ADDRESS`).
- Top-up handling:
  1. Validates available USDC balance on Stellar testnet.
  2. Verifies wallet PIN and decrypts secret key.
  3. Ensures USDC trustline exists.
  4. Calls the DeFindex client to construct Soroban deposit XDR.
  5. Signs with user keypair and broadcasts via the DeFindex send endpoint.
  6. Updates plan balance in MongoDB and logs `type: "SAVINGS_DEPOSIT"` in the transaction ledger.
- Withdrawal handling enforces locking restrictions, builds withdraw transactions, signs and broadcasts to redeem funds back to the user's Stellar wallet, and updates ledger state.

---

## 5. Milestone 3: Cross-Chain Bridging (Simulation & Testnet Staging)

Enables **simulated cross-chain stablecoin transfers** between **Base Sepolia** and **Stellar Testnet** using Allbridge Core mathematical fee formulas within Jumpa's unified confirmation drawer.

> [!NOTE]
> **Upstream Provider Context & Staging Rationale:**
> Following the exploit on Allbridge Core liquidity pools, pool-based routes have been paused upstream by the Allbridge team as they transition away from pool models. Consequently, a live on-chain Stellar pool was unavailable for direct settlement. Jumpa models the deterministic quoting and fee structures (0.3% LP fee + relayer gas) to stage the cross-chain drawer, card UI, and ledger flow without simulating on-chain settlement.
> 
> To maintain complete accounting transparency:
> - The flow is explicitly labeled in the UI as **`Bridge (Simulation)`** with mode **`Simulated Staging`**.
> - In the database, bridge transactions on testnet are saved under `status: "SIMULATED"` so they cannot be read or audited as settled on-chain.
> - The receipt card displays `status: "Simulated"` and does not fabricate a fake on-chain transaction explorer hash.

### 5.1 Quoting Engine & Fee Calculation
Uses Allbridge Core's mathematical fee model:
- **LP Fee Rate:** `0.30%` (`0.003`)
- **Destination Relayer Gas:** `0.15 USDC` (flat fee covering destination execution)
- **Slippage Tolerance:** `0.5%`
- **Settlement Time:** `2-4 minutes`
- **Chain Resolution:** Normalizes names (`"base"`, `"base sepolia"`, `"stellar"`, `"stellar testnet"`).
- Produces deterministic, production-accurate quote structures:
  ```json
  {
    "fromToken": "USDC",
    "toToken": "USDC",
    "fromChain": "base",
    "toChain": "stellar",
    "amountIn": "100.00",
    "amountOut": "99.55",
    "rate": "1 USDC = 1 USDC",
    "fee": "0.45 USDC",
    "provider": "Allbridge Core (Simulation)",
    "estimatedTime": "2-4 minutes"
  }
  ```

### 5.2 AI Tool Execution & Preserved UI Integration
The AI assistant handles `bridge_tokens`, formats parameters for the bridge card, and flags confirmation requirements. The card explicitly identifies the route as a **`Simulated Staging`** operation.

### 5.3 Confirmation & Ledger Accounting
In the bridge execution branch:
1. Validates user PIN against the wallet pin hash.
2. Resolves source Base address and destination Stellar address.
3. Records simulated bridge transaction in MongoDB under the transaction ledger:
   - `type: "BRIDGE"`
   - `status: "SIMULATED"`
   - `bridgeDetails`: `{ provider: "Allbridge Core (Simulation)", fromChain: "base", toChain: "stellar", ... }`
4. Returns receipt card data displaying bridged values, Allbridge provider attribution, simulated delivery estimate, and `status: "Simulated"`.

### 5.4 Tranche 3 Migration Plan: Circle CCTP (Native USDC)
For production cross-chain transfers in Tranche 3, Jumpa will migrate from pool-based bridging to **Circle CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol)**:
- **Architecture:** 1:1 burn-and-mint between Circle's official contracts on Base and Stellar (Soroban SAC).
- **Security:** Eliminates third-party liquidity pool risks, wrapped token risks, and slippage.
- **Protocol Flow:**
  1. **Burn:** User signs `depositForBurn()` on Base Sepolia `TokenMessenger`.
  2. **Attestation:** Circle Iris attestation service observes and signs the burn attestation.
  3. **Mint:** Attestation is submitted to Stellar's CCTP `MessageTransmitter` to mint native Circle USDC directly to the user's Stellar wallet.

---

## 6. Milestone 4: Sovereign Key Authorization & Decryption Loop

All transactional actions across Swaps, Transfers, DeFi Yield, and Bridging share Jumpa's **Unified Security Paradigm**:

1. **Non-Custodial Key Storage:**
   - Seed phrases and private keys are never stored in plaintext.
   - Credentials are encrypted at rest using **AES-256-GCM** with a unique salt and initialization vector (IV) per wallet.
2. **Ephemeral In-Memory Decryption:**
   - Keys are decrypted in memory only during active transaction signing when the user supplies their 6-digit PIN.
   - Decrypted credentials are discarded immediately after signing; they are never persisted to session state or logged.
3. **Atomic Verification:**
   - Rate-limiting and lockouts are enforced against brute-force PIN attempts.
4. **Comprehensive Auditing:**
   - Every on-chain or simulated action writes an immutable record to the `Transaction` collection in MongoDB with transaction hashes, timestamps, and network parameters.
