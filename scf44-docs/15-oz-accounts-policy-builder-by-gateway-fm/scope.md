# What this milestone deliberately does not do

Each entry below is scheduled rather than dropped, and says why it is not here yet. The
distinction matters: a reader deciding whether to depend on this tool should be able to tell
what was left out on purpose from what was overlooked.

Section numbers refer to `docs/architecture.md`.

1. **Live acquisition adapter** (`getLedgerEntries` → `AccountState` with `NextId`/`Count`
   reconciliation and transitive closure). The largest remaining gap to RFP #7:
   `prepare_install_intent` requires a `Safe` authority-surface verdict, and the pure core is
   complete and tested but fed a caller-supplied snapshot. Excluded because it is only
   verifiable against a live network, so most of it cannot be test-driven offline.

2. **Containerized build, and the BuildManifest provenance fields that go with it** (§4.4,
   §6.3 — container image digest, source commit and dirty-tree status, template-pack hash,
   canonicalization version, build target). The builder is labelled `local-unattested`, which
   is what it is. Adding manifest fields rehashes every manifest, so the container and the
   fields land together at a release gate. The memory, disk and cgroup limits in §4.6 are part
   of that work and are **not** claimed today. §6.3 carries a scope note listing the fields the
   manifest holds against the ones it does not, so the gap is stated rather than left for a
   reader to find by diffing the document against the struct.

3. **A real reviewed policy wasm at layer 2** (F5d). The blocker is not a dependency bump:
   `stellar-accounts` 0.7.2 ships `src/policies/*.rs` as *library helpers*, and its
   `#[contract]` wrappers exist only under `src/*/test/` — so **OpenZeppelin publishes no
   policy wasm**. Pinning one means building a policy contract from their source and deciding
   what review status that artifact has. Related: `simple_threshold` and `weighted_threshold`
   appear in the documentation and never in code.

4. **Encoded-literal rendering** — template-pack v2, and one deliberate artifact-hash break.

5. **Layer-2 deny-code agreement.** A generated deny-code suite
   (`contracts/differential/tests/generated_suite.rs`) is a later-milestone deliverable and is not
   in this tree; when it arrives it asserts the permit/deny boolean only. What this tree has is the
   hand-written `differential.rs`, which agrees with the compiled contract on the verdict *and* the
   deny reason — a stronger comparison over fewer cases.
