## 4. Deep-Dive Security Findings & Mitigations

### [AV-01] Strict Authorization Matrix [VERIFIED-SECURE]
- **Analysis**: Plamen requires verifying that every state-modifying function enforces `require_auth()`.
- **Finding**: In `soroban-contract/src/lib.rs`:
  - `init`: `oracle_address.require_auth()` ensures only the designated oracle identity can initialize the instance.
  - `rotate_oracle_keys`: Line 151 enforces `current_oracle.require_auth()`, ensuring an attacker cannot overwrite the oracle key without holding the existing oracle private key.
  - `rotate_drand_pk`: Line 177 enforces `oracle_addr.require_auth()`.
  - `request`: Line 940 enforces `requester.require_auth()`, guaranteeing that fee deductions cannot be unauthorized.
  - `timeout_refund`: Line 238 enforces `requester.require_auth()`, preventing griefers from triggering refunds arbitrarily.
  - `fulfill`: Line 428 enforces `oracle_addr.require_auth()`, in addition to cryptographic verification.
  - `cleanup_proof`: Line 748 enforces `caller.require_auth()` and restricts caller to requester or oracle.

### [EPA-01] Checks-Effects-Interactions & Re-entrancy Protection [VERIFIED-SECURE]
- **Analysis**: Cross-contract callbacks can be exploited to re-enter `fulfill()` or manipulate contract state before state commitment.
- **Defense-in-Depth Implementation**:
  1. **Checks**: Oracle address auth, Ed25519 signature, drand BLS signature, alpha seed derivation, and BLS12-381 pairing check are all executed upfront.
  2. **Effects**: `Fulfilled(request_id) = true` and `Proof(request_id)` are written and committed to persistent storage BEFORE any external call is initiated.
  3. **Interactions**:
     - `Fulfilling(request_id) = true` transient flag is set immediately before callback dispatch.
     - Any attempted re-entrancy into `fulfill()` triggers:
       - Layer 1: Soroban host VM re-entrancy rejection.
       - Layer 2: `Fulfilling` guard panic (`"fulfill already in progress"`).
       - Layer 3: `Fulfilled` guard panic (`"already fulfilled"`).
  4. Verified by test: `test_reentancy_guard_blocks_during_callback`. Since callback isolation
     (`try_invoke_contract`), the blocked re-entry no longer panics the outer call: the test
     asserts a `cb_failed` event and that no proof was written by the re-entrant call.
  5. **Callback failure isolation (audit round 4, #1):** a panicking `on_vrf()` can no longer
     revert `fulfill()`. See `test_panicking_callback_does_not_revert_fulfill` and
     `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` → *Callback griefing*.

### [CD-01] Confused-Deputy Mitigation on Callbacks [VERIFIED-SECURE]
- **Analysis**: A malicious actor could specify an arbitrary external contract and function to execute with the VRF contract's authority.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Line 203: `requester != callback_contract` reverts immediately. A caller can only request a callback to their own contract address.
  - Line 206: `callback_fn != "on_vrf"` reverts immediately. Callbacks cannot be directed to arbitrary functions (e.g. `transfer` or `mint`).

### [MB-01] Elimination of Modulo Bias in Random Range Derivation [VERIFIED-SECURE]
- **Analysis**: Reducing a **64-bit** hash value with `candidate % max` introduces statistical bias whenever `max` does not divide $2^{64}$. The deviation between residue classes is bounded by $max / 2^{64}$, which is negligible for small ranges (dice, percentages) but approaches a **50% skew** as `max` approaches $2^{63}$.
- **Superseded mitigation (removed)**: an earlier version rejected candidates $\ge \text{u64::MAX} - (\text{u64::MAX} \bmod max)$ and, after 10 attempts, **fell back to a plain `candidate % max`**. That fallback was biased, and the documented failure probability of $2^{-640}$ was **incorrect**: the per-attempt rejection probability is $(\text{u64::MAX} \bmod max + 1) / 2^{64}$, which tends to $1/2$ as `max` tends to $2^{63}$ — making the biased fallback reachable with probability $\approx 2^{-11}$, not $2^{-640}$.
- **Current mitigation — "extra bits" reduction (NIST SP 800-90A B.5.1.3 style)**:
  - `derive_random_in_range` draws **128 bits** of hash entropy and reduces modulo `max`.
  - For uniform $x \in [0, 2^{128})$ and any $max < 2^{64}$, the deviation between residue classes is bounded by $max / 2^{128} \le 2^{-64}$ — cryptographically negligible.
  - Properties: **no biased fallback path**, **constant cost** (exactly one `sha256`, no loop, deterministic instruction count), and **deterministic** output for identical inputs.
  - The client-side helpers `deriveRandomFromBeta()` (JS SDK) and `derive_random_from_beta()` (Rust SDK) use the same 128-bit reduction, but they are **not the same function** as the contract's: they reduce the first 16 bytes of `beta` directly, while the contract reduces `sha256("VREP_DERIVE_V1" ‖ beta ‖ context)`. Their outputs differ for the same request.
  - **Deployment status:** the 128-bit method is in the source. The live Mainnet contract (`CBTCC5QL…`, WASM `90ad8499…`) was deployed **before** this change and still runs the earlier bounded rejection loop. This was confirmed by calling it on Mainnet request #1 with `max = 2^63 + 12345` and matching the old algorithm's output. The biased fallback affects only very large `max` values (see above). Ranges used in practice (dice, percentages, indices) are unaffected. A redeployment is needed to ship the fix on-chain.
  - Verified by tests: `test_derive_random_in_range_bounds`, `test_derive_random_in_range_worst_case_sampling`, `test_property_derive_random_in_range_boundary_max_one`, and `test_property_derive_random_in_range_fuzz_various_ranges`.

### [SL-01] Storage Rent Reclamation & Bounded Growth [VERIFIED-SECURE]
- **Analysis**: Storing 384-byte cryptographic proofs indefinitely causes rent accumulation on Soroban.
- **Mitigation**:
  - `cleanup_proof(request_id, caller)` enables the requester or oracle to purge `Proof`, `RequestContext`, `CallbackContract`, and `CallbackFn` from persistent storage, reclaiming storage rent.
  - The `Fulfilled(request_id)` boolean is preserved indefinitely to maintain auditability and prevent replay fulfillment.
  - `timeout_refund` similarly removes obsolete request context data immediately.

### [GH-01] Computational Instruction Budget Verification [VERIFIED-SECURE]
- **Analysis**: BLS12-381 pairings are computationally intensive. Soroban enforces a strict transaction limit of 100,000,000 CPU instructions.
- **Empirical Measurement** (documented in `PROFILING.md` and verified in `test_budget_combined_nonzero_fee_fulfill_estimate`):
  - G1 negation: **4,031 instructions**
  - Hash to G1 $\times 2$: **5,285,530 instructions**
  - Two BLS12-381 pairing checks (drand + VRF): **50,453,962 instructions**
  - SAC Token Transfer (fee payout): **221,988 instructions**
  - Combined Nonzero-Fee Fulfill Total: **56,122,588 instructions**
  - **Headroom**: **43,877,412 instructions (43.9% remaining capacity)** below Soroban cap.
