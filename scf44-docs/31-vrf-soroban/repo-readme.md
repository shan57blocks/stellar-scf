# Stellar VRF Oracle

A production-grade **Verifiable Random Function (VRF)** oracle for the Stellar/Soroban blockchain. Uses BLS12-381 cryptography with the [drand](https://drand.love) distributed randomness beacon to deliver tamper-proof, publicly auditable on-chain randomness.

## How It Works

```
Your dApp  ──request()──▶  VRF Contract  ◀──fulfill()──  Oracle
                                │                          │
                                │                    drand beacon
                                │                    BLS-VRF proof
                                ▼
                      ✓ Pairing check verified on-chain
                      ✓ Random output recorded on-chain
                                │
Your dApp  ◀─derive_random_in_range()──┘
```

1. Your dApp calls `request()` on the VRF smart contract
2. The oracle fetches a **future** drand quicknet beacon (`round_offset ≥ 2` rounds after the current one, i.e. under normal ledger-clock alignment it is published 3–6 s after the request ledger closes. That delay is what prevents prediction, and it is not a hard guarantee: it depends on the ledger timestamp tracking real time)
3. Oracle generates a BLS12-381 VRF proof bound to your context + drand randomness
4. The contract verifies the proof with **on-chain BLS12-381 pairing checks** (~58M CPU instructions)
5. The verified random output (`beta`) is written to contract storage and emitted in the `fulfill` event. `cleanup_proof()` (requester or oracle) removes only the bulky proof: the `Fulfilled` flag and the 32-byte `beta` are kept, so `get_beta()` and the `derive_*()` functions keep working. All entries are still subject to Soroban storage TTL. Read or cache your result after fulfillment (see [Storage TTL Management](docs/OPERATIONS.md#storage-ttl-management)).
6. Anyone can independently re-verify — no trust required

## Quick Start — JavaScript SDK

Published on npm as
[`stellar-vrf-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stellar-vrf-sdk). Requires
**Node.js ≥ 22.12.0** (`@stellar/stellar-sdk` v17 `engines.node`).

```bash
npm install stellar-vrf-sdk @stellar/stellar-sdk
```

> **Note for npm v1.0.0:** use `Networks.PUBLIC` instead of `Networks.MAINNET`
> (the `MAINNET` alias lands in v1.0.1). See
> [docs/SDK_RELEASE.md](docs/SDK_RELEASE.md).

```typescript
import { VrfClient, Networks } from "stellar-vrf-sdk";
import { Keypair } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

const client = new VrfClient({
  contractId: "CBTCC5QL5T3JSLEZO4PH6LSJYEQF6GEFDCAO67OXI4DTM5NXMK6TSUHU",
  rpcUrl:     "https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com",
  networkPassphrase: Networks.PUBLIC,   // Networks.MAINNET also works from v1.0.1
  keypair:    Keypair.fromSecret("S..."),
});

// Request verifiable randomness
const context = new TextEncoder().encode("audit-round-42");
const requestId = await client.request(context);

// Wait for oracle fulfillment (~10-30s)
const proof = await client.waitForFulfillment(requestId, 120_000);

// Derive a random number in range [1, 1000] (exactly uniform, no modulo bias)
const result = await client.deriveRandomInRange(requestId, 1n, 1000n);
```

> **SDK 2.x requires the next contract deployment.** SDK 2.0 calls the new
> derivation signatures (`derive_random_in_range(request_id, max)`, no
> `context`). The Mainnet instance above still runs the older WASM, whose
> `derive_random_in_range` also takes a `context` argument. Use SDK 1.0.1
> against it until the redeployment is live. See
> [Deriving values](#deriving-values-from-a-result).

### Deriving values from a result

| Function | Output |
|---|---|
| `get_beta(id)` | the raw verified 32-byte output |
| `derive_random(id)` | a uniform `u64` |
| `derive_random_in_range(id, max)` | a value in `[0, max)`, **exactly** uniform |
| `derive_range_for_domain(id, domain, max)` | same, plus a short domain separator for several independent draws per request |

The inputs are the request id, `max` and `beta`, all fixed before anyone can
see the result. Earlier versions also took a free-form `context` argument at
derivation time. That let a caller who had already seen `beta` try many
contexts and keep the output they liked (grinding). It has been removed. Put
application data into `request(context)` instead: that value is committed
before the drand round is public.

> ⚠ **`derive_range_for_domain`: the domain must be fixed before fulfillment.**
> Use constants in your code (`b"card-1"`, `b"card-2"`) or values stored before
> `request()`. Never forward a user-chosen value there. The contract can't
> tell when a domain was chosen.

The SDKs reproduce all of these offline from `beta`
(`deriveRangeFromBeta` / `derive_range_from_beta`, …), byte-for-byte, using
shared test vectors.

## Quick Start — Rust SDK

Published on crates.io as
[`stellar-vrf-sdk`](https://crates.io/crates/stellar-vrf-sdk):

```bash
cargo add stellar-vrf-sdk
```

## Quick Start — Soroban Consumer Contract (Rust)

Your Soroban contract can request randomness and receive results via callback:

```rust
// Request: your contract calls the VRF contract
let request_id: u64 = env.invoke_contract(
    &vrf_contract,
    &Symbol::new(&env, "request_with_callback"),
    vec![&env, context, self_addr.clone(), self_addr, Symbol::new(&env, "on_vrf")],
);

// Callback: VRF contract calls your on_vrf() after fulfillment
pub fn on_vrf(env: Env, request_id: u64, beta_output: BytesN<32>, _alpha_seed: BytesN<32>) {
    let vrf_contract: Address = /* stored at init */;
    vrf_contract.require_auth(); // CRITICAL: verify caller is the VRF contract
    // Use beta_output as your random value. Keep on_vrf() cheap: the oracle
    // refuses to send a fulfill() whose simulated cost exceeds its resource
    // bounds (see "Consumer callbacks" below).
    // If this panics, fulfill() still succeeds and you are NOT called again:
    // read the result later with get_beta(request_id).
}
```

See [`consumer-example/`](consumer-example/) for a complete working example.

## Key Features

- **On-chain BLS12-381 verification** via Soroban host functions (CAP-0059)
- **drand quicknet binding** with future-round enforcement — oracle cannot predict input
- **Callback support** — `request_with_callback()` for fully on-chain composability
- **Oracle key rotation** — atomic BLS + Stellar + Ed25519 key rotation
- **High availability** — primary + hot-standby on separate hosts with Redis leader election, validated by a live failover drill on Mainnet ([evidence](docs/HA_FAILOVER_EVIDENCE.md))
- **Re-entrancy protection** — transient lock per request ID
- **Storage TTL extension** — automatic TTL renewal on all persistent entries

## Trust Assumptions & Known Limitations

Please read these before integrating on Mainnet. Details are in [`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md).

- **Single oracle identity.** One oracle key (Stellar account + BLS + Ed25519) controls `fulfill()`, `rotate_oracle_keys()` and `rotate_drand_pk()`. HA removes the *availability* single point of failure, but not the *key* single point of failure. If that key is lost, the oracle can't be rotated and requests can only be refunded. **If it's stolen, or its holder misbehaves, outputs can be biased, not just withheld.** `fulfill()` verifies against the keys registered *at fulfillment time*, and the same account can switch the drand key to one it controls (`rotate_drand_pk`), which lets it choose alpha. It can also grind BLS keys once a round is public (`rotate_oracle_keys`). This affects pending requests too. **The oracle is therefore a trusted party for bias resistance and unpredictability.** Monitor `rotate_ok` / `rotate_dk` events, and treat multisig / a hardware signer for the oracle account as a requirement. Per-request key snapshots and a rotation timelock would remove this. They need a redeployment and are not implemented ([details](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md#trust-assumptions)).
- **Request fee is currently 0 on Mainnet.** The deployed instance was initialised with `fee_amount = 0`, and `fee_amount` is immutable (no setter, no upgrade entrypoint). Anyone can create requests for the cost of the network fee alone, and the oracle pays about 0.14 XLM per `fulfill()`. Unchecked, **spam requests could drain the oracle account.** The worker's **fee guard** ([details](docs/OPERATIONS.md#economic-guard-zero-fee-contract)) bounds this:
  - It always keeps a minimum balance.
  - It serves an optional requester allowlist without limit.
  - For anyone else, it caps the **total transaction fees** at `UNPAID_BUDGET_XLM_PER_HOUR` (default 1.5 XLM) per rolling hour. The fee is reserved before *every* send, including retries. With Redis HA, the budget is shared across primary and standby and survives restarts.
  - Only a fee paid in native XLM counts as "paid".

  Deferred requests stay pending. After the timeout, requesters can recover their escrowed fee with `timeout_refund()`, but that doesn't deliver the randomness. **What this means for integrators:** anyone can use up the shared unpaid budget with spam. The current instance therefore **does not guarantee liveness** to non-allowlisted requesters, whose requests may time out and be refunded. The structural fix is a redeployment with `fee_amount` ≥ the fulfill cost. `mainnet_deploy.mjs` now refuses to deploy without one.
- **Fulfillment is best-effort, not guaranteed.** HA, the fee guard and reconciliation make fulfillment likely, but no component guarantees it. The contract guarantees only that a result, *if* delivered, is correct and final, and that an unfulfilled request can be refunded after `TIMEOUT_ROUNDS`.
- **Consumer callbacks are isolated from panics, not from cost (source; next deployment).** If your `on_vrf()` panics, `fulfill()` still succeeds, your callback's writes are rolled back, and a `cb_failed` event is emitted. Read the result with `get_beta()`. Soroban can't cap a sub-call's resources, though: `on_vrf()` runs inside the oracle's transaction and the oracle pays for it. An expensive callback can push `fulfill()` past network limits, and then **no** result is delivered. The worker therefore:
  - simulates every `fulfill()` and refuses to sign it if CPU, resource fee or max fee exceed `MAX_FULFILL_INSTRUCTIONS` (default 90M), `MAX_FULFILL_RESOURCE_FEE_STROOPS` or `MAX_FULFILL_TX_FEE_STROOPS`;
  - treats deterministic failures (contract panic, trapped / resource-limit-exceeded callback, refusal above) as **terminal**: the request is parked instead of retried, and the requester can `timeout_refund()`;
  - caps sends per request (`MAX_SENDS_PER_REQUEST`) for everything else.

  The deployed Mainnet instance still reverts `fulfill()` on a callback panic ([details](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md#callback-griefing-economic-dos-on-the-oracle)). **Keep `on_vrf()` small.** Store `beta` and do the heavy work in a later transaction.
- **drand chain is fixed.** `rotate_drand_pk()` rotates the key of the *configured* drand chain. It can't migrate the contract to a different drand chain (genesis/period/scheme are fixed). See [OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md#rotate-drand-public-key).
- **Results are not stored forever.** See step 5 above.
- **The Mainnet WASM predates the current derivation and deployment fixes.** The deployed contract:
  - still uses the earlier `derive_random_in_range` rejection loop, which has a biased fallback (reachable only for `max` approaching 2^63; everyday ranges are unaffected);
  - still accepts a caller-chosen `context` at derivation time, which can be ground (see [Deriving values](#deriving-values-from-a-result));
  - was configured by a separate `init()` call;
  - numbers drand rounds one behind drand's own numbering (round 1 is at genesis), so the round a request is bound to is only **one** round ahead of the published beacon (0–3 s lead, sometimes already public at request time) instead of two (3–6 s under normal ledger-clock alignment). The requester still can't predict the output, but "even the oracle can't know the beacon at request time" does not hold on this instance ([details](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md#trust-assumptions)).

  The source replaces all four. Round numbering follows drand (`floor((now − genesis) / period) + 1`). Range derivation is **exactly** uniform (two-candidate rejection sampling, explicit failure with probability < 2^-128, no biased fallback). There is no derivation-time context. Configuration is atomic via `__constructor`, with key validation (no identity/generator/off-curve keys, oracle ≠ drand key). These changes ship with the next deployment ([details](docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md)).
- **"Can't bias" is conditional.** With the registered keys unchanged, the oracle can neither predict nor bias an output. The oracle account *can* rotate keys (see "Single oracle identity" above), and anything a caller chooses **after** seeing `beta` (for example a domain passed to `derive_range_for_domain`) can be ground by that caller. The contract only binds inputs committed before the drand round is public.
- **SDK scope.** The Rust SDK is a read/verify client. It doesn't submit transactions ([details](sdk/rust/README.md#scope--read-this-first)).

## Performance

`fulfill()` **without a callback** measured at **58,073,400 CPU instructions** (fee=0) and **58,342,003 CPU instructions** (nonzero-fee) on Stellar Mainnet. That is 22.2% headroom under the 75M target and 85.4% under the 400M protocol limit. See [`docs/PROFILING.md`](docs/PROFILING.md).

**Scope of the 75M figure:** it covers the **VRF core** only (drand signature check, BLS-VRF verification, Ed25519, storage, fee transfer), and a unit test enforces it. A callback request adds whatever the consumer's `on_vrf()` costs, which the contract can't bound. The worker's resource guard (`MAX_FULFILL_INSTRUCTIONS`, default 90M) is the operational cap for that case.
